# Capacitance Meter with Bluetooth LE reading possibilities using an Adafruit Feather nRF52

Repo for a project with the goal of using an Adafruit Feather nRF52 to measure capacitances and to transmit the signal via Bluetooth Low Energy.
This repo also contains an Android App, developed with MIT App Inventor, for reading the signal.

## Implementation

### Capacitance Measurement

My interest was in measuring small capacitances.
For this, I used the approach proposed in this [post](https://wordpress.codewrite.co.uk/pic/2014/01/21/cap-meter-with-arduino-uno/), 
and modify it in order to use an Adafruit Feather nRF52.

As explained in the original post, this is a pretty simple approach that works reasonably well for capacitances in the order of pF.
It makes use of the fact that microcontroller board will always present a stray capacitance.
By connecting the capacitor of interest in series with this stray capacitance e.g., between two analog pins (see scheme below), 
the voltage on the output pin will settle to within 1% of itâ€™s final value few ns after raising the voltage of the input pin from zero to some high value. 
The value to which the voltage of the output pin will settle is proportional to the ration between the capacitance to be measured and the total capacitance i.e., the capacitance of interest plus the stray capacitace, times the high voltage value in the input pin.

This approach requires estimating the stray capacitance. This can be done just by connecting to the board a known capacitor, and use the same approach to estimate the stray capacitance instead.

### Scheme

The setup is similar to that proposed in the original post for Arduino Uno, but using an Adafruit Feather nRF52:

### Reading data through a serial port

The repo includes the code to read the capacitance data through a serial port. The code is found in the file Serial_Capacitance.ino within the Serial_Capacitance folder.

It can be uploaded to the microcontroller with the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software_). Be aware that in order to do so, you will need first to [install](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluefruit-nrf52-feather-learning-guide/arduino-bsp-setup) 
the corresponding package in the IDE.

The first thing you will need to do is to calculate the stray capacitance, and use this value in the code. For this, in the set up above use a capacitor of known value.
Then in the code, comment the following line:

```
//float capacitance = (float)val * IN_CAP_TO_GND / (float)(MAX_ADC_VALUE - val);
```

and uncomment the line inmediately after:

```
float capacitance = 4.7 * (1023.0-val)/(val*1.0);
```

In this line, change 4.7 by the value of the capacitor (in pF) you have used.

Upload the code, and read the value provided by the serial port. This will be the stray capacitance. For this you can use the Arduino IDE Serial Monitor. I have also worked on a [Python GUI](https://github.com/JSotres/serialReaderPython) 
that you can use for the same purpose.

Once you have found the stray capacitance, insert this value in the following line of the code (i.e., replace 9.3 by the value you found):

```
const float IN_STRAY_CAP_TO_GND = 9.3; 
```

Then, comment:

```
//float capacitance = 4.7 * (1023.0-val)/(val*1.0);
```

and uncomment:

```
float capacitance = (float)val * IN_CAP_TO_GND / (float)(MAX_ADC_VALUE - val);
```

If you upload now the code to the microcontroller, you will be able to read through the serial port the value of an unknow capacitor.

### Reading data through LE Bluetooth

To transmit the capacitance value via LE Bluetooth, upload to the microcontroller the code available in the file BLE_Capacitance.ino that you can find in the folder BLE_Capacitance.

Do not forget firs to update the value of the stray capacitance in the corresponding code line (i.e., replace 9.3 by the value you found following the procedure detailed above):

```
const float IN_STRAY_CAP_TO_GND = 9.3; 
```

With this you are basically ready to go. Nevertheless, the repo also provide, within the folder AndroiddApp, an Android application developed with [MIT App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/)
to monitor the transmitted signal. 

#### Android application

There are different ways to use this app with a smartphone with Android:

##### MIT AI2 Companion application

- In your smartphone, download (from Google Play) and install the MIT AI2 Companion application.
- Then, in your computer web browser go to the MIT App Inventor (you will need to log in with a Google account).
- Go to *Projects*, then to *Import project (.aia) from my computer ...* and import the file/project *radBLEnRF52.aia* that you will find within the AndroidApp folder.
- Go to *Connect* and then to *AI Companion*. You will get both a barcode and a code.
- Open in you smartphone the MIT AI2 Companion application. Then, either scan the barcode or provide the code.

##### Packed application

- Open this repo with your smartphone and then download and install the file radBLEnRF52.apk also available in the AndroidApp folder.

###### App short guide

When you open the app, you should see something like this:

Make sure that Bluetooth is enabled in your device. Then:

(i) Scan for available devices.

(ii) Select the Adafruit Feather nRF52 from the list of available devices.

(iii) Connect (or disconnect).

(iv) When connected, the capacitance value should be sown in the screen.
